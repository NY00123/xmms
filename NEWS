This is a brief overview of user-visible changes in AdPlug/XMMS.

Changes for version 1.3:
- Bugfix: Workaround for bug in XMMS' OSS output plugin.
- Bugfix: Calculate songlength for default subsong of added files.
- Now plays default subsong of a file if no subsong was selected
  (previously played subsong 0).

Changes for version 1.2:
- Bugfix: When pressing pause and then stop, XMMS did lock up.
- Song info box is now user resizeable. This also avoids annoying
  window size changes due to rapid status text size changes.

- Made the installation target directory configurable through the
  'xmms_input_plugin_dir' variable.
- Implemented "Formats" config-dialog tab.
- Implemented "Quick detect" feature.
