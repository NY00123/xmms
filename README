Copyright (C) 2002, 2003 Simon Peter <dn.tlp@gmx.net>

Website: http://adplug.sourceforge.net/

Description
-----------
AdPlug/XMMS is an XMMS input plugin. XMMS is a cross-platform multimedia
player. AdPlug/XMMS uses the AdPlug AdLib sound player library to play back
a wide range of AdLib (OPL2) music file formats on top of an OPL2 emulator.
No OPL2 chip is required for playback.

Prerequisites
-------------
The following things are needed in order to compile this program:

Item				Version
----				-------
AdPlug library			>= 1.3
pthreads (POSIX threads)	*
XMMS				>= 0.9.5.1
GLib				>= 1.2
GTK+				>= 1.2

The AdPlug library can be obtained from http://adplug.sourceforge.net/.

pthreads should have come with your system.

XMMS can be obtained from http://www.xmms.org/.

GLib and GTK+ can be obtained from http://www.gtk.org/.

Installation
------------
Refer to the file 'INSTALL' for installation instructions.

If you like to set a custom installation directory for the plugin to be
installed to, like for example '$HOME/.xmms/Plugins/Input', you can specify
the variable 'xmms_input_plugin_dir' (all lowercase) to the 'configure'
script, like this:

./configure xmms_input_plugin_dir=$HOME/.xmms/Plugins/Input

to install the plugin into '$HOME/.xmms/Plugins/Input' in this case.

CVS
---
If you checked out from CVS, first run:

autoreconf --install

to generate the build cruft and get the configure script. You need recent
versions of autoconf, automake and libtool to do this.
